        <p>My experience includes enterprise software delivery with companies/initiatives such as HealthCare.gov, Blue
          Cross Blue Shield, United Healthcare, Meridian Health, Delta Dental of Michigan, Ford Motor Company, General
          Motors and more. In addition to my current role, my previous roles include delivery manager, technical lead,
          accessibility lead, user experience and user interface designer/developer/consultant, scrum master and even
          technical writer.</p>
        <p>I am well-versed in Agile software development, including Scrum and SAFe methodologies. I am a Certified
          Usability Analyst (CUA) by Human Factors International and have obtained Scrum Master certification. I work
          closely with product owners, executive leadership, vendors and management to ensure successful development and
          design to deliver world class software.</p>
        <p>My specialties are user experience (UX) strategy, UX leadership, user interface (UI) design, UX design, and
          software accessibility supporting ADA and WCAG standards for impaired users. I've implemented accessibility
          (a11y) awareness, development and design practices within large organizations. I've also created multiple
          style guides and HTML/CSS responsive frameworks, as well as <a
            href="https://memberportal.com">memberportal.com</a> and <a
            href="https://mysmilecoverage.com">mysmilecoverage.com</a>.</p>
        <p>I reviewed, assessed, documented and groomed a11y test results into story cards according to logical
          groupings of work. I was able to institute an a11y practice and discipline in my current role that hadn't
          previously existed. I trained developers, testers, tech leads and BAs on what a11y means and how we build
          software to be accessible from design all the way to production.</p>
